<h1>What is spot trading?</h1>

<p>Spot trading is the process of directly buying and selling financial assets for payment "on the spot". You can trade on the spot with any assets - cryptocurrencies, securities, fiat currencies and commodities. You can conclude spot transactions on centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency platforms, as well as on stock exchanges and Forex.</p>

<h2>What is a spot trade</h2>

<p>The word “spot deal” should be understood as a simple order that is executed at the moment when two counterparties have agreed to sell/buy an asset. There are also fixed-term contracts that are concluded immediately, but are executed after a certain period of time.</p>

<p>In spot trading, both the seller and the buyer must have assets available at the time of the transaction. Such a condition is established so that after the conclusion of the transaction, the buyer immediately receives the acquired asset, and the seller receives the money. The cost of the contract when concluding such transactions is called the word spot-price.</p>

<p>You can see the price at which the contract will be concluded in the order book, and the cost of selling the asset after the execution of the transaction is displayed in the feed.</p>

<p>Traders can use the spot price in the following cases:</p>

<p>concluding simple spot deals;</p>

<p>determining the underlying value of an asset in the process of calculating derivative points;</p>

<p>assessment of price accuracy when conducting futures transactions;</p>

<p>Performing settlements during the closing period of obligations under futures contracts.</p>

<p>Calculations on derivative positions are not carried out immediately, but the spot price on the exchange is taken as a basis.</p>

<h2>Features of spot transactions</h2>

<p>Not all contracts of this type are instantaneous. Sometimes the settlement of spot transactions is carried out a little later - in accordance with the regulations of the exchange.</p>

<p>For example, in traditional markets, all spot contracts can be divided into three main types:</p>

<p>TOD(T+0). The name of this group of transactions is an abbreviation for the word today - "today". That is, the calculation is performed on the day the contract is concluded.</p>

<p>TOM(T+1). Abbreviation for the word tomorrow - "tomorrow". When such positions are opened, they are settled on the next trading day.</p>

<p>SPT(T+2). From the English word spot - "place". Settlement under the contract is carried out two days after its conclusion.</p>

<p>The words TOD and TOM are used only in the foreign exchange market. The T+ format is used on stock exchanges.</p>

<p>In the cryptocurrency market, such designations are not used. But sometimes spot-positions here may not be held immediately either.</p>

<p>The term of calculation and sale depends on three indicators:</p>

<p>asset liquidity;</p>

<p>spot rate at which the transaction is carried out;</p>

<p>Number of coins to buy or sell.</p>

<p>If there is enough cryptocurrency in the order book to fill an open position, the transaction is executed immediately. Otherwise, the transfer of the asset may occur later.</p>

<h2>How to trade on the spot market</h2>

<p>When conducting spot deals, you need to take into account that the level of profit depends on the effectiveness of analytics. And the most common type of contracts in the spot market are positions that are executed instantly.</p>

<p>In most cases, three types of orders are used for spot trading:</p>

<p>A simple market order. Executed almost instantly at the current price. In other words, the trader chooses only the desired asset and the volume of the transaction.</p>

<p>Limit order. In this case, the trader can select an asset, specify its price (limit) and the volume of the transaction. The order will not be executed immediately, but only at the moment when the rate reaches the specified price (limit level).</p>

<p>Limit stop order. This type of order works in the same way as a limit order, but is not placed immediately. Along with the coin price (limit), the trader also indicates the order activation rate (stop). The position is opened at the moment when the value of the coin approaches the activation price (stop).</p>

<p>All three types of orders can be opened for buying and selling. Similar types of transactions are also used in the derivatives market, but there they are placed at the time of the conclusion of the contract, and not during its implementation.</p>

<p>Simple spot-trades on the cryptocurrency exchange can allow traders to earn tangible amounts. But for this you need to be able to choose promising tokens in order to sell them at a bargain price.</p>

<h2>How the deal works</h2>

<p>Regardless of the market, a spot purchase or sale on an exchange occurs as follows:</p>

<p>An application is submitted indicating the asset, its price and quantity.</p>

<p>The amount of assets required for the execution of the contract is blocked from the seller. And the required amount is frozen on the buyer's account.</p>

<p>After the transaction is concluded, the asset is transferred to the buyer, and the money is transferred to the seller.</p>

<p>At the same time, the deadlines may vary depending on various factors.</p>

<p>For example, spot securities contracts may be delayed. This is due to the fact that the data on investors who have concluded a spot deal must be recorded in the depository and in the register of shareholders.</p>

<p>The Forex market is essentially a spot market. Therefore, there is no need to wait for the transfer of the asset: all transactions are executed instantly. And after opening a position, the trader does not receive a physical supply of currency, but the right to use it.</p>

<p>In the cryptocurrency market, a trader specifies the price of an asset at which he wants to buy or sell it. If the desired coin value is available, the position is filled instantly. In the absence of the required price, a trader can open a simple limit order. Then the transaction will be executed at the moment when the value of the token in the order and on the market coincide.</p>

<p>To take the following situation as a simple example:</p>

<p>The trader wants to buy 100 ETH at the rate of $1000.</p>

<p>There is only 80 ETH in the order book at a price of $1000.</p>

<p>In this case, the deal can close according to one of two scenarios:</p>

<p>80% of the order volume will be executed immediately. Another 20 ETH will remain in an open position until a trader appears who wants to sell this volume at a price of $1000.</p>

<p>The entire volume of the order will be executed immediately. But only 80 ETH is sold at $1000. And the rest of the position will be closed at a higher price (which depends on the availability of orders in the order book).</p>

<p>In other words, in the first case, the trader will not be able to complete his transaction immediately, and in the second case, not at the desired price. On the Binance exchange, such problems are leveled due to high liquidity.</p>

<h2>Pros and cons of the spot market</h2>

<p>The advantages of spot trading include:</p>

<p>The ability to simply open positions in real time.</p>

<p>Transparency and ease of trading. People with minimal experience in trading can work with assets on the spot market.</p>

<p>Projected profitability of operations.</p>

<p>The ability to open long (buy) and short (sell) positions.</p>

<p>Opening deals for any period of time - from a few seconds to several years.</p>

<p>There are some downsides to trading on the spot market:</p>

<p>Mandatory availability of assets for both counterparties. On the derivatives market, a deal can be executed even if the buyer and seller do not have the required amount of coins. Spot trading excludes this possibility.</p>

<p>The level of volatility in the spot market is lower than in the forward market. Active traders consider this a disadvantage, as they derive their profits from high volatility.</p>

<p>Increased entry threshold. To conclude a contract, you need to ensure the volume of assets corresponding to the minimum lot.</p>

<p>As a result, spot trading on the exchange potentially gives less profit than working with the futures market. However, it is less risky.</p>

<h2>How the spot market differs from other markets</h2>

<p>The main difference comes down to payment terms. On the spot market, you need to pay immediately or after a maximum of two days (if we are talking about traditional assets). With such trading, it will not be possible to work with options and futures.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the derivatives market allows you to make a deal now and transfer the asset later. For example, when trading futures, a user may agree with a counterparty to buy or sell in the future. Accordingly, the execution of the contract also occurs later - at the set time.</p>

<p>There is also no margin on the spot, since this trading format requires the amount of assets needed to complete the trade. Margin trading involves the use of borrowed funds. In other words, a trader can trade without having enough of his own assets.</p>
