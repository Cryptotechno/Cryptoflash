                            <h1>Decentralized identity in Web3 - how blockchain and NFT can achieve it</h1>
                            <h2>Key findings</h2>

                            <p>Decentralized digital identity is a system in which users' personal data is stored in a
                                single non-custodial identity wallet. So users can have full control over their digital
                                identity, and not depend on centralized services to store and maintain information.</p>

                            <p>Using blockchain to maintain decentralized digital identity can provide proper security
                                and privacy, effectively protecting the user's identity from data leakage and theft.</p>

                            <p>Today, the personal data that makes up a person's digital identity is often stored
                                centrally and linked through devices, apps, and third-party services. In this model,
                                users have no control over what personal data they choose to share and how, making them
                                potentially more vulnerable to data breaches and cyberattacks.</p>

                            <p>With the advent of Web3, the way we interact on the Internet has changed.
                                Blockchain-based applications operate independently and without intermediaries, creating
                                a decentralized internet where the user can be the sole owner of their data. Web3 users
                                can set up their profiles and store personal data in a single account that can be used
                                for everything from accessing social networks to logging into crypto wallets.</p>

                            <h2>What is decentralized identity</h2>

                            <p>Decentralized Identity is a new ideology in which identities should only be held by the
                                person they represent. Users can create and control their digital identities and not be
                                dependent on third party service providers. Decentralized Digital Identity (DDID) is a
                                decentralized system that aims to transform the current centralized identity management
                                with blockchain technology.</p>

                            <p>For example, a digital credential standard called Verifiable Credentials (VC) allows you
                                to store credentials in the form of tokens in a non-custodial wallet. Users may disclose
                                all or some aspects of their identity and personal information to third parties such as
                                the government, banks or schools at their discretion. At the same time, the presence of
                                a single source facilitates data storage. Another example is Sovereign Identity (SSI),
                                which consists of verified and authentic credentials linked to real verification data
                                and managed in a decentralized way.</p>

                            <h2>How decentralized identity works in Web3</h2>

                            <p>Decentralized identity gives users full control over their personal data on the Internet.
                                On Web3, people from all walks of life can express themselves and interact in new ways
                                using tools like NFT and blockchain. It is they who can become decisive factors that
                                open the door to a new world of freedom and great opportunities. In it, everyone can
                                create a unique NFT avatar that will represent him and contain a unique identifier that
                                is protected from forgery. All this makes interaction in digital communities safer.</p>

                            <p>Typically, a decentralized repository, such as a non-custodial identity wallet, is used
                                to store a user's decentralized identifiers (DIDs). This could be a wallet app or
                                browser extension that allows users to create their own decentralized identity and
                                manage access to third party service providers. In this case, the users are the sole
                                owners of the respective public and private cryptographic keys. Some wallets use other
                                authentication methods to protect data. For example, sovereign identity (SSI) associates
                                a user's credentials with real-world verification data such as biometrics and stores
                                them on the blockchain. Thanks to this, users can control their digital identities
                                themselves without the participation of third parties. More importantly, SSI stores
                                information in non-custodial wallets that are solely controlled by users, which ensures
                                the security of personal data.</p>

                            <p>To prove their identity in the Metaverse, users can sign a transaction with their private
                                key or biometric data in applications that allow decentralized identification for
                                authentication. The service provider will then use the decentralized identity shared by
                                the user to look up the corresponding unique DID on the blockchain.</p>

                            <h2>What are Soulbound Tokens (SBT)</h2>

                            <p>Soulbound tokens (SBT) were proposed by one of the founders of Ethereum (ETH) Vitalik
                                Buterin. They are non-transferable NFTs that are unique to a particular person and are
                                forever tied to a digital wallet (Soul). SBTs are similar to achievement badges and can
                                be used to store a variety of personal information such as resumes, diplomas, club
                                memberships, and so on. They can be tracked publicly, so fake information is almost
                                impossible. For example, a Web3 company hiring software developers might use SBT to
                                validate candidate certificates. Or an artist can issue an NFT from their Soul Wallet to
                                verify that the work is theirs.</p>

                            <p>With SBT, users can experience benefits that will change the way we think about social
                                identity in real life. Such tokens can confirm the identity of a person and his
                                reputation, which helps to establish trust in decentralized spaces.</p>

                            <p>The advent of SBT suggests that Web3 can be more than just a medium for financial assets.
                                Such tokens provide information about users, thereby giving a sense of real human
                                relationships in the digital world. After all, SBT describe the qualitative
                                characteristics of a person: his achievements, abilities, membership in any
                                organizations, and much more. They can change how people interact on the blockchain by
                                combining resumes and social media profiles.</p>

                            <p>Binance recently announced that it is ready to release Binance Account Bound (BAB), the
                                first ever SBT on the BNB Chain blockchain. This will be an additional feature that will
                                allow Binance users who have passed identity verification to create BAB directly on
                                their wallets.</p>

                            <h2>Benefits of decentralized identity</h2>

                            <p>Decentralized identity gives users full control over their digital data and allows them
                                not to depend on a centralized server. With its help, they do not need to constantly
                                enter a login and password, which makes it easier to manage identification and biometric
                                data in the metaverse and the Web3 environment.</p>

                            <p>With decentralized identity, users can choose which part of the information to provide to
                                third-party service providers. This puts control back in the hands of users, making data
                                management easier with a single identity wallet.</p>

                            <p>Using a blockchain for decentralized identity also ensures proper security and privacy.
                                Data can only be unlocked and viewed with valid digital signatures, protecting users
                                from hacking and identity theft. At the same time, decentralized identification data
                                stored on the blockchain is immutable and less vulnerable to attacks than data on
                                centralized servers. Once recorded in a distributed network, information cannot be
                                deleted or edited, so no external entities can modify user records.</p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                            <p>Decentralized digital identity is one of the latest technologies that could play an
                                important role in the Web3 revolution. With this identification, users can easily log
                                into all their accounts without remembering a lot of logins and passwords. Its added
                                benefit is increased security and data protection in the metaverse. At the same time,
                                organizations can provide users with personalized services without violating their
                                privacy. Perhaps decentralized digital identity will appear earlier than expected:
                                startups and well-known companies are already engaged in this technology. For example,
                                Microsoft's new Entra product allows users to verify, secure, and control all types of
                                identities and access requests. However, the implementation of decentralized identity on
                                a global scale will not happen overnight - it requires a joint effort of cooperation and
                                coordination between organizations and governments.</p>
