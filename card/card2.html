                            <h1>Cryptocurrency arbitrage: what it is, how it works, and how to make money on the
                                difference in cryptocurrency rates</h1>

                            <p>The essence of cryptocurrency arbitrage is to conduct a quick series of trading
                                transactions to earn on the difference in the rates of one or more assets. Such trading
                                can be done manually or using special programs and bots.</p>

                            <h3>What is cryptocurrency arbitrage</h3>

                            <p>To make money in the market, you need to buy assets at a low rate and sell when they rise
                                in price. The difference between the cost of buying and selling becomes the trader's net
                                profit. Arbitrage trading works on a similar principle.</p>

                            <p>The rate of one cryptocurrency at the moment may differ on different platforms. For
                                example, Bitcoin can cost $20,000 on Binance and $20,500 on another exchange. It is this
                                difference that arbitrage traders use to make money.</p>

                            <p>An inter-exchange transaction is carried out in two stages:</p>

                            <p>buying a cryptocurrency on an exchange where the price is lower;</p>

                            <p>Selling the same asset on another exchange where the price is higher.</p>

                            <p>There is also intra-exchange arbitrage, when orders are opened on the same site. In this
                                case, the trader earns on the difference between the rates of one asset in different
                                trading pairs.</p>

                            <p>The exchange rate of a particular cryptocurrency depends on various factors. For example,
                                the intra-exchange price of BTC in pairs against USDT and against BUSD may differ.
                                Trading commissions and withdrawal conditions also affect the cost.</p>

                            <p>In addition, the demand for the exchange matters:</p>

                            <p>Large trading platforms have a high level of liquidity, so their quotes are as close as
                                possible to the market average.</p>

                            <p>For small exchanges, liquidity for new coins may be too low, and quotes may differ
                                markedly from the average market.</p>

                            <p>Unlike conventional trading, when arbitrage buying and selling must be carried out as
                                soon as possible, without waiting for the market situation to change. To speed up this
                                process, you can use special bots.</p>

                            <h3>Money on arbitrage</h3>

                            <p>For arbitrage, a trader needs to create and set up accounts on all platforms where he
                                plans to earn. In the process of trading, you need to look for coins, the rate of which
                                differs on different exchanges or in different pairs.</p>

                            <p>During the day, a trader can monitor a large number of charts. As soon as it was possible
                                to find suitable values, you need to conduct a deal. There are special programs and bots
                                that allow you to automate this process.</p>

                            <p>An inter-exchange transaction can be carried out using one of two algorithms:</p>

                            <p>Open a long order on one exchange and immediately open a short order on another exchange.
                            </p>

                            <p>Buy cryptocurrency on one exchange and transfer it to another exchange to sell it at a
                                higher price.</p>

                            <p>In the second option, the rate may have time to change to the unfavorable side during an
                                inter-exchange transaction. In this case, the price difference may disappear and the
                                trader will not earn anything. Therefore, for arbitration, it is better to choose
                                cryptocurrencies that are created on blockchains with high bandwidth.</p>

                            <h3>Money Strategies</h3>

                            <p>There are several types of cryptocurrency arbitrage to earn on the difference in rates.
                            </p>

                            <p>Intermarket Arbitrage</p>

                            <p>This is the most popular way to make money on the difference in cryptocurrency rates. The
                                more platforms are used for inter-exchange arbitrage, the easier it is to find a
                                noticeable gap in quotes.</p>

                            <p>It is quite difficult to track the situation on different exchanges and coins on your
                                own. Therefore, traders use bots and programs to automate inter-exchange arbitrage.</p>

                            <p>Such bots are able to independently analyze hundreds of trading pairs on dozens of
                                cryptocurrency exchanges (centralized and decentralized). Statistics show that trading
                                programs now account for up to 99% of arbitrage deals.</p>

                            <p>Also, traders sometimes buy signals for arbitrage trading. In this case, the bot or
                                program gives notifications about which cryptocurrencies and on which exchanges you need
                                to buy or sell.</p>

                            <p>The following factors can be attributed to the difficulties of inter-exchange arbitrage:
                            </p>

                            <p>Restrictions from trading platforms. Exchanges that are under the control of regulators
                                can monitor suspicious activity and block it.</p>

                            <p>The possibility of delaying the withdrawal from the exchange. Any transactions that take
                                time in the arbitrage process increase the risk of reducing profits or incurring losses.
                                This factor is offset by the use of long and short orders.</p>

                            <p>The need to take into account commissions for transactions and inter-exchange
                                transactions. They reduce the profit from the difference between the buy and sell price.
                            </p>

                            <p>Incorrect work of bots. A program that automatically opens orders affects the trader's
                                profit and loss. In some cases, the bot may start making losing trades. If you do not
                                turn it off in time, you can get a loss up to the complete zeroing of the deposit.</p>

                            <p>The key advantage of inter-exchange trading is the possibility of making a profit with
                                almost no risk. For arbitrage, a normal profit from one chain of transactions is 0.01%,
                                but with intensive trading, you can get even higher income.</p>

                            <h3>Intra-Exchange Arbitrage</h3>

                            <p>Intra-exchange arbitrage involves a series of transactions within one platform. In this
                                case, at least three related trading pairs are used. Profit is obtained due to the sharp
                                correlation of rates.</p>

                            <p>For an example, you can take conditional assets:</p>

                            <p>Cryptocurrency X is worth $1000.</p>

                            <p>Cryptocurrency Y costs $100.</p>

                            <p>In this case, 1X will cost 10Y. However, during a sharp increase in trading volumes in
                                the X/Y pair, the exchange rate may jump, for example, to the value of 1X = 11Y. At the
                                same time, the prices of both assets in fiat terms may remain at the same level.</p>

                            <p>In such a situation, a trader can conduct a series of trades:</p>

                            <p>Buy 1 x coin for $1000.</p>

                            <p>Exchange 1X for 11Y.</p>

                            <p>Sell 11Y for $1100.</p>

                            <p>Thus, the trader's earnings on the intra-exchange rate difference amounted to $100.</p>

                            <p>Taking into account the costs of commissions, intra-exchange arbitrage is more profitable
                                than working with several sites, since you do not need to pay for transferring funds
                                between them.</p>

                            <p>Another advantage of this type of arbitrage is that the trader does not waste time on
                                transactions between exchanges. Therefore, trading in the intra-exchange arbitrage
                                format allows you to quickly respond to market changes.</p>

                            <p>A noticeable drawback of intra-exchange arbitrage is the restrictions imposed by the
                                exchanges themselves. They constantly analyze quotes in order to identify the
                                correlation of rates. The found difference is quickly eliminated, which is why arbitrage
                                often gives zero profit.</p>

                            <p>In order to increase the overall income, it is better to combine OTC and OTC arbitrage.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Multi-currency inter-exchange arbitrage</h3>

                            <p>This trading method combines intra-exchange and inter-exchange arbitrage, when several
                                cryptocurrencies and several exchanges can be involved in transactions.</p>

                            <p>For example, a trader can execute the following series of trades:</p>

                            <p>On exchange A, buy ETH with USDT.</p>

                            <p>On exchange B, exchange ETH for BTC.</p>

                            <p>On exchange A, sell BTC for BUSD.</p>

                            <p>Such chains of transactions are quite difficult to identify and conduct manually.
                                Therefore, the use of bots is especially important for them.</p>

                            <p>Working with different markets</p>

                            <p>Experienced arbitrage specialists can transact between the spot and futures markets.</p>

                            <p>When opening positions on futures, different contracts are used - perpetual, monthly,
                                quarterly, etc.</p>

                            <p>This type of arbitrage gives tangible results on strong market movements. Typically,
                                transactions are made when news impulses are formed. At this time, there may be a high
                                difference between the spot price and the contract rate.</p>

                            <h3>Tools (software) for cryptocurrency arbitrage</h3>

                            <p>There are various programs to optimize the arbitration process. They help you quickly
                                track quotes and conduct transactions on different exchanges.</p>

                            <h3>Currency scanners</h3>

                            <p>Rate scanners allow you to monitor the rise and fall in the value of a large number of
                                assets on selected exchanges. Typically, such programs have a user-friendly interface
                                that displays trading data in the form of tables and graphs.</p>

                            <p>The arbitrageur analyzes the information received and makes decisions about buying or
                                selling cryptocurrency. Operations must be performed manually.</p>

                            <p>Paid scanners provide maximum efficiency, they provide the most accurate information
                                without delay.</p>

                            <h3>Course comparison software</h3>

                            <p>Such programs also compare quotes of selected assets on different cryptocurrency
                                exchanges, but they need to be downloaded to a computer or mobile device.</p>

                            <p>The basic functions of such software may vary:</p>

                            <p>comparison of the cost of all digital assets on selected sites;</p>

                            <p>analysis of the value of selected coins on all exchanges.</p>

                            <p>A trader can customize such software according to their preferences by selecting the
                                desired cryptocurrencies and exchanges for tracking.</p>

                            <h4>Bots for arbitrage</h4>

                            <p>Unlike programs for obtaining reference information, a trading bot fully automates
                                inter-exchange and intra-exchange transactions.</p>

                            <p>Such programs can independently perform all the necessary actions:</p>

                            <p>24/7 analyze quotes on stock exchanges according to the settings;</p>

                            <p>look for spreads that allow you to make a profit;</p>

                            <p>eliminate the problem of the human factor, acting strictly according to the algorithm;
                            </p>

                            <p>quickly conclude deals when a favorable market situation arises.</p>

                            <p>Many paid arbitrage bots have a demo version that allows you to evaluate their quality.
                            </p>
