<h1>Dive into the Sandbox metaverse for new tokens</h1>
<h3>What is Sandbox</h3>
<p>With the development of crypto technologies, Play-To-Earn projects began to gain popularity. Users like to play and receive digital assets for their actions. The Sandbox Game is one of the first and most successful games in this segment.</p>
<h4>What is Sandbox Game</h4>
<p>The Sandbox Game is a P2E (play-to-earn) multiplayer online project that allows you to start earning money while playing.
This platform is created as a metaverse that combines several different technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Крипто</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Блокчейн</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Game</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> NFT</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> DeFi</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>The virtual world of the Sandbox game is designed so that any user can help develop it:
<ul>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Create characters and objects</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Change game space</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Manage virtual items</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Build digital territories and more</li>
</ul>
<br>
Players are offered the maximum choice of activities.
</p>
<h4>Mechanics </h4>
<p>In the Sandbox, the user can move around the map, perform various tasks and complete mini-games. Not all levels are opened for new players, only a part of the tasks is initially available. A reward is given for successful completion.

<p>An example is the parkour-game mini-game. As part of this quest, you must move along the specified route and collect glowing cubes, overcoming the current obstacles. </p>

<p>After completing some tasks, the player receives tickets (Ticket). They can be used to participate in lotteries. The more tickets, the higher the chance to win the main prize. </p>
<h4>Full and open world</h4>
<p>In order to give users freedom of action, the developers of the Sandbox game have created a three-dimensional world with a large number of activity options. The peculiarity of this process is that players can begin to fill the digital space with objects that they themselves have created. That is, gamers are the authors of certain parts of the metaverse.
<br>
<p>
You can create the following objects:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Virtual Goods</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Аватары</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Own mini-games. To do this, you need to use the Game Maker tool and the VoxEdit program</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> NFT-токены</li>
</ul>  </p>
<p>
Every player has the ability to buy and own digital territories, and the metaverse offers many ways to use them. </p>
<h4>Procedurally generated world</h4>
<p>The Sandbox metaverse is constantly changing due to the activities of the players:</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Users can design their own maps, thus updating the base set of locations</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Generated maps contain objects created as digital assets - NFT</li>

</ul>  </p>
<p>
Thanks to such processes, the metaverse is constantly evolving and increasing its profitability. And the players remain motivated to play and explore all the new levels. </p>


<h4> Same gameplay and no goal in the game</h4>
<p>In standard games, the user has a key task - to complete all levels or defeat opponents. The Sandbox project does not focus on a single game goal. Instead, there is a large set of tasks, and the player can decide which ones to complete and which not. </p>
<p>For their actions, users receive NFT objects or crypto tokens, after which they can begin to perform other tasks. Thus, the play-to-earn principle is implemented - play to earn. </p>
<p>In Sandbox, the emphasis is on constant immersion in the metaverse. The developers neglect the plot, but pay maximum attention to creating interesting and diverse game mechanics. </p>
<h4>Why crypto games are not for everyone</h4>
<p>There are several reasons why the Sandbox crypto game won't work for some users. </p>
<h5>No game goal</h5>
<p>For those who like to immerse themselves in the complex process of passing, sandboxes may seem boring and primitive. Many people like the purposeful destruction of virtual enemies or overcoming the difficulties in rpg games. There is no such atmosphere in Sandbox. </p>
<h5>Difficult to adapt after a pause</h5>
<p>Procedurally generated worlds change rapidly due to the active actions of a large number of users. Also in such projects there are always a lot of tasks. If you pause for a week or more, then remembering all the important nuances of the gameplay can be difficult. The need to start delving into numerous details again is repulsive to some users. </p>
<h5>You need to immerse yourself in the virtual world for a long time</h5>
<p>In the case of Sandbox, you won't be able to play fast and become the owner of a valuable NFT. The game is focused on the fact that users will stay inside the metaverse for a long time. The player himself is also interested in the process and begins to actively complete tasks when he realizes that he can earn cryptocurrency. With limited free time, it will be difficult to develop in such games.</p>
<h5>High entry threshold</h5>
<p>There are a lot of locations and mechanics in the Sandbox game. To start earning, you need to master a serious amount of information: the reward system, where, what and how to do it. At the same time, new users need to invest money in order to expand their capabilities and start earning. </p>
<p>Not everyone has the motivation to study the game conditions for a long time and risk their money. Therefore, when choosing Sandbox Game, it is important to immediately tune in to a long process. And in order to increase your chances of making a profit, you need to act very steadily. </p>
<h4>How the world of the Sandbox Game works</h4>
<p>In order to maintain the scale and flexibility of the Metaverse, developers use a few basic tools. </p>
<h5>SAND</h5>
<p>The game has its own SAND currency: it is an ERC20 token. It is used as an internal unit of account and is also traded on external exchanges. Accordingly, the cost of SAND depends on the market balance of supply and demand, and its rate affects all game objects. </p>
<h5>LAND</h5>
<p>This is a digital land divided into parcels, each of which is an ERC-721 token. By becoming the owner of such a site, the player receives ownership of everything that is located within its boundaries. </p>

<p>The Sandbox Game area has the following stats:</p>
<p><ul>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> The size is 408 x 408 plots. Now only a part of them has been acquired.</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> The maximum number of sites in the game is 166,464.</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> Each parcel is 96 x 96 virtual meters.</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> One meter in a sandbox contains 32 voxels. A voxel is a three-dimensional pixel.</li></ul> </p>

<p> You can buy LAND with SAND. Owners are allowed to cultivate the land themselves or invite other players to do this. You can also rent your own location.</p>

<h5>ASSET</h5>
<p>These are ERC-1155 tokens that players can create themselves or buy from other users. If desired, they can be transferred to other virtual worlds. </p>
<p></p>ASSET is configured for various game tasks. For example, to fill in purchased plots (LAND) with digital objects. </p>
<h5>Avatar</h5>
<p>This is the representation of the player inside the virtual world. The avatar is customized and equipped with suitable ASSETs. The correct equipment of the avatar allows you to effectively solve game problems.</p>
<h5>Gem</h5>
<p>These are ERC-20 tokens that act as a spending unit. Players can use them to change the characteristics of their ASSETs. For example, to increase the level of strength or magic. The content of individual gems may vary, so they need to be chosen for a specific case. </p>
<p>You can get Gem by staking SAND. To use it, it must be placed in the ASSET socket. After use, it is burned. </p>
<h5>Catalyst</h5>
<p>Catalyst is needed to determine the current ASSET level and its deficit. This is also an ERC-20 token that is burned after use (just like Gem). When you add a catalyst to a digital object, it gets an empty slot that can be filled with GEM. </p>
<p>The better the Catalyst you add, the more sockets ASSET will get. It is necessary to strive to ensure that ASSET has the smallest deficit and the highest level. You can get a catalyst by staking SAND.</p>

<h4>What are NFTs and how they are used in the game </h4>
<p>NFT is a non-fungible token. That is, one token cannot be replaced by another, since each of them is inimitable and unique. This crypto technology is used to fix ownership of a real or digital object in the blockchain.</p>
<p>In The Sandbox Game, all user-created objects are automatically converted to NFTs. For example, it could be a virtual animal owned by the player. The owner can increase the uniqueness of his animal by changing its characteristics. Then this NFT can be sold or exchanged for other NFTs. </p>
<p>You can get unique objects in the following ways: </p>
<p><ul>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> participate in tournaments, quests, battles;</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> equip digital territories with paid entrance;
</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> create new textures and rent them out;</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> to stream games and receive donations;</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> open stores with items that have a price increase potential;</li>
<li><img src="../img/target.svg" alt="" width="25" height="25"> mine resources for the purpose of their further sale.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>As a result, the user always has the opportunity to monetize their gaming experience by selling objects created and received in the Sandbox.</p>
<h4>Current state of the SAND token</h4>

<p>The SAND price reached an all-time high on November 25, 2021 at $8.4. Starting from January 2022, the value of the crypto asset began to gradually fall. In early April, it was estimated at $3.5. The current price of SAND is slightly above $1. </p>
<p>The cost of the SAND token in this case depends on the popularity of The Sandbox Game project. If the game consistently attracts new users and retains regular players, then the token rate will go up.</p>
<p>Analysts assume that by the end of the year the price of The Sandbox will reach $1.5. In a favorable scenario, this crypt can rise in price to $2. </p>
<p>In addition, SAND tokens can be used in the game itself. For example, upgrade characters (making them more expensive) or buy game objects with unique characteristics. There is also the possibility of obtaining passive income through staking.</p>
